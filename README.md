# NP-hardness of ℓ0 minimization problems

Our report and presentation of the paper [NP-hardness of ℓ0 minimization problems: revision and extension to the non-negative setting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9030937).

Following this work, we also propose a complete analysis on the NP-hardness of the penalized ℓ0 problem.

This is the final project of our course "Compressed Sensing" - Professor Guillaume Lecue (ENSAE).
